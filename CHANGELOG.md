### Fixed
- PR #161 restore NewtonsoftJson dependency.

## [6.0.0] - 2020-09-27
### Fixed 
- Issue #132 Support `[System.Text.JsonPropertyNameAttribute]`. This is a breaking change which rewrote how the examples
 are generated. Instead of explicitly using Newtonsoft's `JsonConvert.SerializeObject()`, I now use whichever JSON
 serializer is registered with the MVC pipeline, i.e. during `services.AddControllers()`.

### Removed
- contractResolver and jsonConverter parameters from `[SwaggerRequestExampleAttribute]`.
- contractResolver and jsonConverter parameters from `[SwaggerResponseExampleAttribute]`.
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson` dependency.

### Changed
- If you are using `options.IgnoreObsoleteProperties();` and you want your Examples to not have the 
  obsolete properties, then you will need to register my custom Newtonsoft `ExcludeObsoletePropertiesResolver`,
  e.g.
```csharp
services.AddControllers()
    .AddNewtonsoftJson(opt =>
    {
        opt.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver = new ExcludeObsoletePropertiesResolver(opt.SerializerSettings.ContractResolver);
```

### Fixed

## [4.1.0] - 2018-08-06
### Added
- Add generic version of SecurityRequirementsOperationFilter and AppendAuthorizeToSummaryOperationFilter so that
they can be used with other attributes. Reason: a client had implemented their own `TypeFilterAttribute`
